# Django-Image-App

This project contains 2 different approaches to implement the image upload website. The first approach which is present on the main branch works more like a social network. So images uploaded by user A would be visible to User B, however only user A can delete the images he uploaded. Also when no user is logged in, the home page displays the images that have been uploaded and the detail can be seen for these images.

The Second approach is present in the approach-b Branch. Here images uploaded by a user would be only visible to that user itself and not to any other users. Also by going to the homepage, if a user isn't logged in, he is redirected to the signup page where as if the user is logged in and doesn't have any images, then he shall see an empty gallery page.
